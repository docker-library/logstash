This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`logstash`](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/) (not to be confused with any official `logstash` image provided by `logstash` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `logstash` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/logstash).

For outstanding `logstash` image PRs, check [PRs with the "library/logstash" label on the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/library%2Flogstash). For the current "source of truth" for [`logstash`](https://hub.docker.com/_/logstash/), see [the `library/logstash` file in the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/logstash).
